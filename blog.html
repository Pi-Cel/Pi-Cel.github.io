<h2>Week 1</h2>
<p>25/01 - 31/01</p>
<p>
The main focus of the first week was figuring out which of the three games we
would work on. Being a programmer, I spent most of the week on gameplay and
mechanics research for those three games, to figure out which was the most
interesting, and which we could expand on. We also had descussions as a team
to try and figure out which game would be the best to work on for us and in
the end decided to go with Castlevania.
</p>
<h2>Week 2</h2>
<p>01/02 - 07/02</p>
<p>
Now that we knew we were going with Castlevania as our base game, we decided
to spend the second week figuring out the setting, themes, and mechanics that
we would change and expand on. In the end, we decided to go with a Sci-fi
setting, and set the game on a space ship, so some of the mechanics I did
research on was low gravity, adding turrets, and having futuristic elemental
weapons.
</p>
<h2>Week 3</h2>
<p>08/02 - 14/02</p>
<p>
Having done mechanics research, we were almost ready to start implementing
them in UE4, but because we lacked experience with blueprints, we decided to
start with smaller assets that would be quicker to implement, thus allowing
us to quickly learn the basics. We had a call amongst the programmer to
where I assigned them the mechanics they would have to implement, we also
discussed how to integrate Git into our workflows. Through this discussion,
we learnt about the built in Git plugin in UE4, which allowed us to see
individual changes to the assets.
</p>
<h2>Week 4</h2>
<p>15/02 - 21/02</p>
<p>
This weeks goal was to merge our individual work into the development branch.
At first we though that it would be easy using the git plugin for UE4, but
having tried it, we realised that it would not work, as it doesn't allow you
to to merge individual differences, only the source or the target. This got
looking for alternatives, and our final decision was to move the blueprints
to seperate components. This would allow us to break the logic into smaller
chunks, meaning that we wouldn't lose work through merging.
</p>
<p>
Since we had to present our work this week, I had a session with the other
leads to create a presentation, and to rehearse it.
</p>
<h2>Week 5</h2>
<p>22/02 - 28/02</p>
<p>
This week I personally have been working on updating and refining the player
movement mechanic as we recieved some feedback pointing out how it could be
improved. One of the issues was the fact that triggers would reset your jump,
meaning you would be able to jump without having to reach the floor. This meant
that I had to redo how I check if the player is touching the floor, and in the
end, I made the trigger that checks if you're on the floor ignore other
triggers, which solved the problem.
</p>
<p>
As the lead programmer for this project, I have also been responsible for
managing the other programmers, making sure they have features to work on, and
also acting as a point of communication between the other diciplines. The way I
decided to distribute the work amongst the team was by organising it by
importance, and then going over each feature and allowing the programmers to
choose them based on their proficencies. Stefan now will be focusing on the
enemy AI movement, while Sam is going to be implementing the camera movement.
</p>
<h2>Week 6</h2>
<p>01/03 - 07/03</p>
<p>
One of the biggest features that we had to implement was the combat. On top of
that we wanted to have a few different weapons at the player's disposal, both
melee and ranged. This meant that we had to implement some sort of inventory
system, and I decided to work on it as I had a lot of experience implementing
inventory systems in previous projects. I decided to go with a fairly basic
system that only kept track of whether you had picked up the weapon to keep it
simple. One of the requirements of the inventory system was to persist between
levels, meaning that weapons picked up in Level 1 could be used in Level 2. To
implement this I decided to use a custom Game Instance which is a class that
isn't destroyed between levels, so is usefull for keeping track of variables
like health, score and in my case the weapons the player has picked up.
