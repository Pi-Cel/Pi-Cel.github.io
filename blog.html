	<h2>Week 1</h2>
	<p>
	The main focus of the first week was figuring out which of the three games we
	would work on. Being a programmer, I spent most of the week on gameplay and
	mechanics research for those three games, to figure out which was the most
	interesting, and which we could expand on. We also had descussions as a team
	to try and figure out which game would be the best to work on for us and in
	the end decided to go with Castlevania.
	</p>
	<h2>Week 2</h2>
	<p>
	Now that we knew we were going with Castlevania as our base game, we decided
	to spend the second week figuring out the setting, themes, and mechanics that
	we would change and expand on. In the end, we decided to go with a Sci-fi
	setting, and set the game on a space ship, so some of the mechanics I did
	research on was low gravity, adding turrets, and having futuristic elemental
	weapons.

	<h2>Week 3</h2>

	TBD.
