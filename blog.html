<h2>Week 1</h2>
<p>25/01 - 31/01</p>
<p>
The main focus of the first week was figuring out which of the three games we
would work on. Being a programmer, I spent most of the week on gameplay and
mechanics research for those three games, to figure out which was the most
interesting, and which we could expand on. We also had descussions as a team
to try and figure out which game would be the best to work on for us and in
the end decided to go with Castlevania.
</p>
<h2>Week 2</h2>
<p>01/02 - 07/02</p>
<p>
Now that we knew we were going with Castlevania as our base game, we decided
to spend the second week figuring out the setting, themes, and mechanics that
we would change and expand on. In the end, we decided to go with a Sci-fi
setting, and set the game on a space ship, so some of the mechanics I did
research on was low gravity, adding turrets, and having futuristic elemental
weapons.
</p>
<h2>Week 3</h2>
<p>08/02 - 14/02</p>
<p>
Having done mechanics research, we were almost ready to start implementing
them in UE4, but because we lacked experience with blueprints, we decided to
start with smaller assets that would be quicker to implement, thus allowing
us to quickly learn the basics. We had a call amongst the programmer to
where I assigned them the mechanics they would have to implement, we also
discussed how to integrate Git into our workflows. Through this discussion,
we learnt about the built in Git plugin in UE4, which allowed us to see
individual changes to the assets.
</p>
<h2>Week 4</h2>
<p>15/02 - 21/02</p>
<p>
This weeks goal was to merge our individual work into the development branch.
At first we though that it would be easy using the git plugin for UE4, but
having tried it, we realised that it would not work, as it doesn't allow you
to to merge individual differences, only the source or the target. This got
looking for alternatives, and our final decision was to move the blueprints
to seperate components. This would allow us to break the logic into smaller
chunks, meaning that we wouldn't lose work through merging.
</p>
<p>
Since we had to present our work this week, I had a session with the other
leads to create a presentation, and to rehearse it.
</p>
<h2>Week 5</h2>
<p>22/02 - 28/02</p>
<p>
TBD.
